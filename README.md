# Image_Classification
Fascinating world of image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 

Key Highlights of the Project:

1.Introduction to CNNs:A type of artificial neural network used primarily for image recognition and processing, due to its ability to recognize patterns in images.

2.Dataset:Used a Kaggle dataset with labeled images. It covers loading, exploring, and preprocessing the data, including resizing, normalizing, and augmenting images to prepare them for the model.

3.Building the Model: Learnt to build a CNN model using TensorFlow,including setting up the architecture (layers, filters, activations) and compiling the model.

4.Training the Model: Tweaking hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and epochs, and tracking accuracy and loss.

5.Evaluation: Evaluation the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to check its performance on the test set.

6.Testing and Deployment: Finally,testing the model with new images and offers tips on deploying it in real-world applications, like integrating into web or mobile apps.
